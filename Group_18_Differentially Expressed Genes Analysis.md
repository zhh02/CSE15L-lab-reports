## 1. Introduction to Differentially Expressed Genes
While biological organisms of the same species may share a substantial portion of their genetic material, the manifestation of this shared genome can exhibit notable differences in terms of gene expression levels among individuals. For instance, one human beingâ€™s DNA blueprints can be 99.9% identical to another, but their expression of shared genes are not necessarily identical. 

According to the central dogma of molecular biology, genes within DNA are transcribed into RNA, which can then form polypeptides or functional protein products through translation. 
Gene transcription and translation processes encompass intricate networks of molecular signals, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifications that collectively influence how genes are activated or suppressed. 

Therefore, gene differential expression study is important to determine the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to certain phenotypes. 


## 2. Differentially expressed genes at the biological level
* __Transctiption:__  regulatory elements interact with DNA and affect overall gene expression.  For instance, certain non-coding RNAs, such as large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), have been found to direct chromatin-modifying complexes to specific genomic loci, thus affecting epigenetic state. Incorporation of nucleotide sequences, like promoters and enhancers, works respectively to initiate transcription and increase transcription rate.
