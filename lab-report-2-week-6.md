# Week 6 Lab Report 2
## Streamline ```ssh``` Configuration
### Step 1: Setting up config file
Find the config file under ```C:\Users\[Custom Username]\.ssh```. If there isn't one, create one. I don't have one so I create a new ```config``` file with no extension.

Then open ```config``` file in VSCode, add following content to it: <br/>
```Host ieng6```<br/>
```    HostName ieng6.ucsd.edu```<br/>
```    User cs15lwi22zzz (use your username)```<br/>
Remember to replace User with your username.<br/>
